## Introduction ##
Love having good food but do not know how to make it? This app has got you covered. This app uses Spoonacular's recipe API. It provide solutions to make any food-related vision a reality. This app can be used to search recipes based on the items you have readily available or wish to consume. Every household has a list of favourite ingredients readily available. Add it to the app only once and be ready to search and try new recipes each time. 😌 <br/>
You can also search for recipes and the nutrient values of a dish based on it's name. Once a recipe is selected the user gets a detailed explanation of how to make it. If you're health conscious and like to keep yourself updated about the nutrients you consume, go ahead and know more about what you consume. Spoonacular guesses nutrients based on multiple recipes and has an accuracy of 95%. ✨
